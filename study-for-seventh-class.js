// remix enables me to build excellent ux and not feel ashamed of the code I had to wrote to achieve it
// removes that huge mark to cross from learning to build web apps with html, css, js to using frameworks
// remix progressively uses js to enhance and not to enable experience

// questions for Jan
// why is remix making it look like everything there is to a website is around forms and links?
// middleware for auth?
// where does the state stay?
// what is hydration?

// mental model for new dev flow
